# REST friend

Writing REST clients in C is easier if you've got a friend

## Compiling

# Make sure you have all the required dependencies:
 * libapp  - https://github.com/drotiro/libapp
 * libjson - https://github.com/vincenthz/libjson/
 * libcurl
# Run `make` and optionally `sudo make install` to get the headers and the library
installed under `PREFIX`
